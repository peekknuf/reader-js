# fReading

A minimalist speed reading tool to help me get through text faster. Just copy plain text, drop in there, and bang, beauty. 
Built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- **Variable reading speed**: Adjust words per minute (WPM).
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:  
  - `Shift` + `+` to speed up  
  - `Shift` + `-` to slow down
- **Highlights the first or middle letter** of each word for better focus.
- **Play/pause/reset controls** for easy navigation.

## Why?

I wanted a simple tool to help me read faster without the bloat of existing speed reading apps. This does exactly what I need and nothing more. Speed and simplicity were really the key factors, might add some QoL features later down the line.

## Usage

1. Paste your text.
2. Set your desired WPM (words per minute).
3. Choose the letter highlight preference (first or middle letter).
4. WE'RE ADDING A LIBRARY of prepared texts, still work in progress though
4. Hit **start** and adjust speed on the fly with keyboard shortcuts, will add dynamic changes with mouse clicks, gotta be better.

That's it! Happy speed reading ðŸš€
